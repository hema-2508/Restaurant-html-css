            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Spice Garden started in 2009 when the our family came to Nagaland from Tirunelveli, India. We missed the taste of home-cooked Indian food, so we decided to open our own restaurant.</p>
            <p>We wanted to share the real flavors of India with everyone. Today, we are happy to see families from all backgrounds enjoying our food and coming back again and again.</p>
